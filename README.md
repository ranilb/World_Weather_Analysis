# World_Weather_Analysis

In this module, you'll practice your analysis, visualization, and statistical skills by retrieving and analyzing weather data for a hypothetical travel company, PlanMyTrip. Successfully completing the tasks will draw on your knowledge of Python, decision and repetition statements, data structures, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy statistics.


PLANMYTRIP is a top travel technology company that specializes in internet-related services in the hotel and lodging industry. Jack is the head of analysis for the user interface team. He's asked you to help him collect and present data for customers via the search page, which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel, anywhere in the world.

To perform this task, you will be using a Jupyter Notebook and the CitiPy module to get the cities for more than 500 random latitudes and longitudes. Then, you will perform requests on the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve the JSON weather data from these cities. The weather data will be added to a Pandas data frame, where you will use Matplotlib to create a series of scatter plots to show the relationship between the latitude and a variety of weather parameters for over 500 cities around the world.

As part of your analysis, you will need to perform statistical calculations on the data using linear regression on the weather parameters in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. This data will help your team predict the best time of year for people to plan their vacation. Finally, you will export the data, clean it, and use the weather data to choose the best cities for vacation based on certain weather criteria, and then map these cities using Jupyter and the Google Places API. Are you ready to help travelers find their ideal vacation spot? If so, pack your suitcase and let's get started.



At the most fundamental level, Jack needs help answering a question: How might we provide real-time suggestions for our client's ideal hotels? Your first task was to define what you meant by "ideal." So, over the course of the conversation, you narrowed that to hotels that were (1) within a given range of latitude and longitude and that (2) provided the right kind of weather for the client.


Here's an outline of your project plan:

Task: Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
Purpose: PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
Method: Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.
